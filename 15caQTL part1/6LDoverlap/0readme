1. prepare the gwas, basically just add the hg38 annotation for finemapped snps
2. first prepare all FDR0.1 results, then run mashR and get the mashR 0.05 results, then save cell type specific caPeak-snp pairs
3. read LD information, save all gwas_snp ~ qtl_snp pairs that are in LD. (one snp could match multiple snps in the other category)
4. check which QTL capeaks contain QTL-snps, save the peak-snp pair information. (tested all mash R snps, nothing to do with LD)
