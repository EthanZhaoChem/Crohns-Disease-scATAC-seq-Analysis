# This function aligns the gene-set data (gene_sets) with the
# gene-wise statistics (gene_scores) by their gene IDs to
# prepare these data for a gene-set enrichment analysis.
# Modified based on the `align_gene_data` function in `single-cell-topics` repo.

# It is assumed that the row names of gene_sets and the row names of
# gene_scores matrices give the unique gene symbols or ids (e.g., Ensembl ids).

# input to fgsea from a collection of gene sets encoded as a matrix.

# Perform gene-set enrichment analysis using the fast method described
# in Korotkevich et al (2016). This method uses permutation testing
# to account for correlations between genes. The p-values are based on
# Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistics which are "normalized" to account
# for differences in gene-set sizes; the normalized test statistics
# are provided in the "NES" (normalized enrichment score) column of
# the output. See also Subramanian et al (2005) for background on the
# method.
#
# Input argument "gene_sets" should be an n x m matrix, in which n is
# the number of genes, and m is the number of gene sets, and entry
# (i,j) is greater than zero if and only if gene i is included in gene
# set j. Input argument z should be a numeric vector of length n
# containing gene-wise statistics, such as z-scores. The elements of
# z should be named.
#
# Input argument "eps" controls the accuracy of the small p-values.
# Here I set it to be much lower than the default setting since some
# of the gene-set enrichment p-values can be quite small.
