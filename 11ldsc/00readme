# history experience
checked the ldsc using enhancers only (corr > 0.5 in peak-gene links), but the analysis suffered from too few peaks 

# history problem
the unlifted folder in each result directory is the trash that can't be lifted from hg38 to hg19,
the trash files all have unlifted.bed as a suffix
go find the original folder for hg38 files, or the hg38 folder if there is one
the lifted folder is hg19
